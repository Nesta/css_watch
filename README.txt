# CSS WATCH

This is a fork of the CSS Watch module on drupal.org:

http://drupal.org/project/css_watch

Instead of using all theme CSS files automatically, this version lets you
choose which CSS files to monitor. This helps to avoid the problem of slow
servers not being able to complete the requests within the time limit.
